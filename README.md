## 🏗️ Architecture
This project follows **Clean Architecture**, which promotes separation of concerns and testability.


### 🧩 Design Patterns Used
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** – Separates read and write operations for better scalability.
- **Generic Repository** – Reduces boilerplate code for data access.
- **Unit of Work** – Manages transactions across multiple repositories.
- **Global Error Handling** – Centralized exception handling for better API responses.
- **In-Memory Caching** – Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + CQRS
- **Database:** SQL Server (EF Core)
- **Caching:** In-Memory Cache
- **Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI
- **Testing:** xUnit / Moq
